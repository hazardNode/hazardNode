# Hey there! 👋 I'm hazardNode

## 🎯 About Me

I'm a digital polymath who believes that variety is the spice of code. From training neural networks to hunting digital breadcrumbs, from crafting pixel-perfect UIs to architecting robust backends, I thrive in the intersection of different technologies and domains.

## 🛠️ What I Do

### 🌐 **Full-Stack Web Development**
From database to browser, I speak the full stack fluently. Because why limit yourself to just one layer when you can debug them all?

### 📱💻 **Desktop & Mobile Development**
Native apps, cross-platform solutions, or whatever gets the job done. If it runs on silicon, I've probably tried to code for it.

## 🐧 **Linux Enthusiast**
Proud EndeavourOS user—because life's too short for vendor lock-in and too long for compiling everything from source. Open source isn't just a philosophy; it's a way of life.

## 💻 Tech Stack

```bash
const languages = ['JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'Python', 'Rust', 'Go', 'C++', 'Java'];

const frameworks = ['React', 'Next.js', 'Vue', 'FastAPI', 'Express', 'Django'];

const tools = ['Docker', 'Git', 'Linux', 'PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB', 'Redis'];

const cloud = ['AWS', 'GCP', 'Azure', 'DigitalOcean'];
```
