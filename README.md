## 🎯 About Me

I'm a digital polymath who believes that variety is the spice of code. From training neural networks to hunting digital breadcrumbs, from crafting pixel-perfect UIs to architecting robust backends, I thrive in the intersection of different technologies and domains.

## 🛠️ What I Do

### 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning**
Building intelligent systems that sometimes work better than their creator (which isn't saying much, but still...). From deep learning models to practical AI implementations.

### 🔍 **Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics**
Digital detective work—because someone has to figure out what happened when things go sideways. Specializing in forensics and incident response.

### 🌐 **Full-Stack Web Development**
From database to browser, I speak the full stack fluently. Because why limit yourself to just one layer when you can debug them all?

### 📱💻 **Desktop & Mobile Development**
Native apps, cross-platform solutions, or whatever gets the job done. If it runs on silicon, I've probably tried to code for it.

## 🐧 **Linux Enthusiast**
Proud EndeavourOS user—because life's too short for vendor lock-in and too long for compiling everything from source. Open source isn't just a philosophy; it's a way of life.

## 💻 Tech Stack

```bash
# Languages I speak (to computers)
const languages = ['JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'Python', 'Rust', 'Go', 'C++', 'Java'];

# Frameworks that don't drive me crazy
const frameworks = ['React', 'Next.js', 'Vue', 'FastAPI', 'Express', 'Django'];

# Tools that keep me sane
const tools = ['Docker', 'Git', 'Linux', 'PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB', 'Redis'];

# Cloud platforms where my code lives
const cloud = ['AWS', 'GCP', 'Azure', 'DigitalOcean'];
```
